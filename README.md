# 🔐 An Explainable LSTM-Based Intrusion Detection System Optimized by Firefly Algorithm for IoT Networks

This project presents an intrusion detection framework for IoT networks using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network optimized by the Firefly Algorithm. It also incorporates **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide explainability for individual predictions, improving transparency and trust in the model.

## 📘 Overview

- **Objective**: Detect anomalous traffic in IoT environments using an LSTM model optimized by a nature-inspired algorithm.
- **Optimization**: Firefly Algorithm is used to tune hyperparameters and improve detection accuracy.
- **Explainability**: LIME is used to interpret model decisions on a per-instance basis.
